## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

agile is benefitting in
1 developing mobile application with frequently change in user requirements
2 projects with high customer demands
3 developing games with frequent updates and customer feedback

waterfall is benefitting in,
1 building projects with fixed budgets and timeframe
2 developing complex hardware system with fixed specification

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

method of quality assurance
1 testing
2 documentation
3 customer feedback
4 continous integration
5 continous learning

importance of high standard
1 ensure software is stable efficient and functions as expected
